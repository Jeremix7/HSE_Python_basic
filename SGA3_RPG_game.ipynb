    "\n",
    "The game **\"Monsters and Artifacts\"** is a text RPG game. The idea of the game is to search for artifacts while traveling through an endless world. When traveling around the world, the player may encounter monsters and bosses. For killing monsters, the player receives experience points, which can later be spent on pumping characteristics. When killing a boss, the player is additionally guaranteed to receive an artifact. It may also turn out that when entering a location there will be no monster or boss in it, then the player can spend the action on rest and restoring health or searching for an artifact in the location.\n",

    "**Game rules:**\n",
    "The gameplay is divided into stages - each stage is an entrance to a certain location.\n",
    "\n",
    "When entering a location , the following scenarios are possible:\n",
    "- there is no one in the location, then the player can spend his turn resting or searching for an artifact in the location.\n",
    "- there is a monster in the location, then the player can try to escape from location and move to the next location or take the fight.\n",
    "- there is a boss in the location, the player is forced to take the fight, it will not work to escape from the boss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description of win scenario** - the player has found N artifacts (the number of artifacts to win depends on the complexity of the game).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description of lose scenarios** - the player died while fighting a monster/boss."
